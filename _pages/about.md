The MechatronicSystems.Group primary objective is to research, innovate, and advance mechatronic systems in various applications. We work on integrating mechanical components, electronics, control systems, and software to create intelligent and autonomous systems. These systems often involve the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and software algorithms to achieve specific functionalities and improve overall performance.

Our current projects include researching and developing solutions that are unique to our environment and context, such as:
- Researching and implementing pose estimation techniques.
- Modelling, design and system identification of a low-cost quadcopter and flight controller.
- Sesnor design for the Antarctic environment.
