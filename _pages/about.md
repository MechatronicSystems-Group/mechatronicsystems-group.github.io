The Mechatronic Systems Group is a collaborative and interdisciplinary team focused on the field of mechatronics. Mechatronics combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science to design and develop intelligent systems and products.

The group's primary objective is to research, innovate, and advance mechatronic systems in various applications. They work on integrating mechanical components, electronics, control systems, and software to create intelligent and autonomous systems. These systems often involve the use of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and software algorithms to achieve specific functionalities and improve overall performance.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
