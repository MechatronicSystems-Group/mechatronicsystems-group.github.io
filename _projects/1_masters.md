The SHARC Buoy is a battery-powered device designed for deployment in the Marginal Ice Zone of the Southern Ocean. A novel wind sensor design is required to measure wind velocity in this environment. Due to likely freezing, no moving parts may be used, therefore, a strain gauge-based sensor has been proposed, although other technologies must be investigated. This sensor is to be incorporated into the SHARC Buoy platform in a future design revision.

This project will involve the following tasks:

1. Investigate wind velocity sensor technologies and wind measurement protocols.
2. Investigate the expected operating conditions in the Southern Ocean and the constraints imposed by them.
3. Review the SHARC Buoy design to inform technology limitations on the proposed sensor.
4. Develop detailed design specifications for the wind sensor project based on the preceding analysis.
5. Development and testing of a prototype sensor and its associated hardware/software.

Key skills:
- Mechatronics design
- Embedded systems development
- Fundamental sciences

Expected outputs:
- 1x MSc (Eng)
- 1x Journal/Conference paper in a leading publication

Supervisors: James Hepworth and Robyn Verrinder
