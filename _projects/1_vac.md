# Research Project: UAV Rotor Thrust Rig

One of the present research focuses within the MechatronicSystems.Group is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To this end, a rotor thrust rig is required to develop a better understanding of the static and dynamic capabilities of various UAV propulsion systems. For example, a quadcopter makes use of a motor-propeller subsystem to develop the necessary thrust and torques.

The thrust rig must be able to measure thrust (using a load cell sensor), motor speed, and current. The measured data must then be displayable in quasi-real-time on a PC via a GUI, and also logged for offline data analysis purposes.

## Project Scope

This project will require the student(s) to:

- Research current solutions
- Perform a detailed CAD design of the physical structure
- Select and integrate instrumentation components
- Design communications, GUI, and logging capabilities on PC
- Conduct preliminary testing of the system

## Candidate Requirements

The ideal candidate(s) will have strong CAD and instrumentation abilities, while also requiring good knowledge of embedded systems and programming.
