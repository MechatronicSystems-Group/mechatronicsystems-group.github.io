# Research Project: UAV Attitude Rig

One of the present research focuses within the MechatronicSystems.Group is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To this end, a UAV attitude rig is required to facilitate testing orientation controllers within a safe, constrained space.

The attitude rig must utilize a 3 degree-of-freedom gimbal that allows for roll, pitch, and yaw motion of the UAV. Additionally, the platform must be able to measure the orientation of the platform based on the gimbal orientation. The measured data must then be displayable in quasi-real-time on a PC via a GUI, and also logged for offline data analysis purposes.

## Project Scope

This project will require the student(s) to:

- Research current solutions
- Perform a detailed CAD design of the physical structure
- Select and integrate instrumentation components
- Design communications, GUI, and logging capabilities on PC
- Conduct preliminary testing of the system

## Candidate Requirements

The ideal candidate(s) will have strong CAD and instrumentation abilities, while also requiring good knowledge of embedded systems and programming.
