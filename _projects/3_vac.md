# Research Project: Pose Estimation and Control of Wheeled Robots

One of the present research focuses within the MechatronicSystems.Group is the pose estimation and control of wheeled robots. The group is currently in possession of a range of different wheeled robots, which have the potential for interesting research outputs. This includes an Arduino-based vehicle and a more powerful Duckiebot.

The proposed project will require the student(s) to make use of the available on-board sensors (such as wheel encoders, IMU, ultrasonics, camera) to determine the pose of the robot. This information can then be used to control the motion of the robot (subject to the limitations of the available information).

## Project Scope

This project will require the student(s) to:

- Research current solutions
- Assemble the platform and integrate the sensors
- Design the sensor fusion algorithm for the pose estimator
- Create a rudimentary control design of the platform
- Conduct preliminary testing of the system

## Candidate Requirements

The ideal candidate(s) will have strong robotics and control engineering abilities, while also requiring good knowledge of programming.
