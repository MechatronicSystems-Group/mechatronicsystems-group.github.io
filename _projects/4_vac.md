# Research Project: Development of MechatronicSystems.Group GitHub Organisation

The MechatronicSystems.Group (MS.G) aims to, over time, develop well-curated, public-facing software and data that are of use both to the group and to the broader research community. This will be facilitated through a public Git organization hosted on GitHub. The Git organization will also be used to manage the projects undertaken by the group.

## Project Scope

This project will require the student to:

- Research, setup, and configure all aspects of the GitHub organization.
- Implement appropriate policies and permissions.
- Create a GitHub Pages site for public-facing content.
- Test and ensure the smooth functioning of the system.

## Candidate Requirements

The ideal candidate will have strong programming and organizational skills, along with prior experience with Git and GitHub.
