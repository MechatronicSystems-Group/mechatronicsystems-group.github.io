Quadcopters serve as exciting, versatile testbeds for a wide range of research and commercial activities. Off-the-shelf, opensource quadcopter platforms exists that facilitate innovative research outputs, but the price and availability of said platforms can be prohibitive for many local research institutes, including UCT. To circumvent this issue, the MechatronicSystems.Group intends to develop an in-house quadcopter that is low in cost and sustainable in terms of using locally sourced components.

This project will focus on the mechanical aspects of the custom-made quadcopter and will involve the following tasks:

- Investigate the current state of the art of physical quadcopter designs.
- Mathematically model the fundamental quadcopter dynamics.
- Design a high-fidelity simulation environment of the quadcopter flight behaviour.
- Model and design a sustainable, low-cost mechanical quadcopter platform with the aid of CAD tools.
- Manufacture and assemble the quadcopter platform.
- Perform low-level system identification of the quadcopter to determine the underlying system parameters.
- Write-up of MSc dissertation and journal/conference paper.

Key skills:
- Mechatronics design
- control systems
- fundamental sciences

Expected outputs:
- 1x MSc (Eng)
- 1x Journal/Conference paper in a leading publication.
