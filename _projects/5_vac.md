# Research Project: Development of MEMS IMU Library for STM32 Microcontrollers

MEMS Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are used prolifically throughout a wide range of modern devices, from aerial robots to smartphones and ocean buoys. Often, similar sensors are employed despite vastly different operating conditions.

The TDK InvenSense ICM20948 and MPU9250 IMUs are widely available MEMS sensors, planned for use in the MechatronicSystems.Group (MS.G). This project involves writing a complete library for these sensors, which can be used on the STM32F0 and STM32F4 microcontrollers.

The library will need to be meticulously developed and thoroughly tested before being pushed to an appropriate repository on the MS.G GitHub.

## Project Scope

The project scope includes:

- Writing a comprehensive library for the TDK InvenSense ICM20948 and MPU9250 IMUs.
- Ensuring compatibility with STM32F0 and STM32F4 microcontrollers.
- Thoroughly testing the library for accuracy and reliability.
- Pushing the library to a designated repository on the MS.G GitHub.

## Candidate Requirements

The ideal candidate will have:

- A strong understanding of programming the STM32F series microcontrollers.
- An interest in MEMS sensors and IMU technology.
