Quadcopters serve as exciting, versatile testbeds for a wide range of research and commercial activities. Off-the-shelf, opensource quadcopter platforms exist that facilitate innovative research outputs, but the price and availability of said platforms can be prohibitive for many local research institutes, including UCT. To circumvent this issue, the MechatronicSystems.Group intends to develop an in-house quadcopter that is low in cost and sustainable in terms of using locally sourced components.

This project will focus on the hardware and electronics aspects of the custom-made quadcopter and will involve the following tasks:

- Investigate current approaches to flight controllers.
- Identify appropriate microcontroller, telemetry, and communications modules.
- PCB design of the flight controller.
- Design a wireless communication protocol between the flight controller and ground station.
- Design the ground station user interface.
- Write-up of MSc dissertation and journal/conference paper.

Key skills:
- Mechatronics design
- embedded systems development
- programming.

Expected outputs:
- 1x MSc (Eng)
- 1x Journal/Conference paper in a leading publication.

Supervisors: Arnold Pretorius and James Hepworth
