Quadcopters serve as exciting, versatile testbeds for a wide range of research and commercial activities. Off-the-shelf, opensource quadcopter platforms exist that facilitate innovative research outputs, but the price and availability of said platforms can be prohibitive for many local research institutes, including UCT. To circumvent this issue, the MechatronicSystems.Group intends to develop an in-house quadcopter that is low in cost and sustainable in terms of using locally sourced components.

This project will focus on the pose estimation and control aspects of the custom-made quadcopter and will involve the following tasks:

- Investigate the current state of the art of on-board pose estimation and control approaches.
- Mathematically model the fundamental quadcopter dynamics.
- Design a high-fidelity simulation environment of the quadcopter flight behavior.
- Design a pose estimation scheme that makes use of on-board sensors (e.g., IMU, camera, GPS) to accurately determine orientation and position.
- Design a robust control scheme that can achieve position control of the quadcopter.
- Investigate time- and energy-optimal waypoint following and trajectory generation methods.
- Write-up of MSc dissertation and journal/conference paper.

Key skills:
- Control systems
- sensor fusion
- programming.

Expected outputs:
- 1x MSc (Eng)
- 1x Journal/Conference paper in a leading publication.
