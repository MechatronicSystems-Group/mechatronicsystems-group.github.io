Our research group focuses on the modelling, design and realisation of complex mechatronic systems. The electromechanical nature of these systems requires an intimate knowledge of integrating hardware (mechanical and electrical), software and control systems into a cohesive whole.
A typical mechatronics project will involve: CAD design and simulation; software and hardware design; hardware-in-the-loop testing; and systems integration and implementation. Our specialisations lie in mobile robotics (wheeled, legged, aerial, marine), robust control design, inertial stabilisation, and embedded systems.
