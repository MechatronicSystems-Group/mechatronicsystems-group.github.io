###### Description

This project will focus on the onboard pose estimation and trajectory generation of a selected quadcopter platform. An off-the-shelf quadcopter will be purchased in order to accommodate a ready-to-go research platform. The student will be required to develop a suitable position and orientation estimation algorithm that is able to accurately locate the quadcopter in free space. In addition, the project will focus on synthesizing a trajectory generation routine appropriate for a quadcopter that is able to perform high-level tasks, such as waypoint following. The proposed solutions will initially be implemented in a simulation environment and ratified prior to its execution on the physical quadcopter.

###### Key skills/interests:

Mathematical modelling, state estimation, control design, MATLAB and Simulink.

###### Expected outputs:

1x MSc (Eng), 1x Journal/Conference paper in a leading publication.

###### Supervisors: 

Arnold Pretorius and Natasha Botha
