###### Description

The SHARC Buoy is a battery powered device designed for deployment in the Marginal Ice Zone of the Southern Ocean.  A novel wind sensor design is required to measure wind velocity in this environment. Due to likely freezing, no moving parts may be used, therefore, a strain gauge based sensor has been proposed although other technologies must be investigated. This sensor is to be incorporated into the SHARC Buoy platform in a future design revision. 

###### This project will involve the following tasks:

- Investigate wind velocity sensor technologies and wind measurement protocols. 
- Investigate the expected operating conditions in the Southern Ocean and the constraints imposed by them. 
- Review the SHARC Buoy design to inform technology limitations on the proposed sensor. 
- Develop detailed design specifications for the wind sensor project based on the preceding analysis. 
- Development and testing of a prototype sensor and its associated hardware/software.

###### Key skills:

Mechatronics design, embedded systems development, fundamental sciences.

###### Expected outputs:

1x MSc (Eng), 1x Journal/Conference paper in a leading publication.

###### Supervisors: 

James Hepworth and Robyn Verrinder
