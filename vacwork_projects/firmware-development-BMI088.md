# Firmware development for a BMI088 IMU

The BMI088 is a modern IMU commonly used in UAV applications. This project involves the development and testing of firmware for this IMU to be run on the STM32F4 microcontroller. This will include:

- Familiarisation with the STM32F4
- Selection of level of code abstraction
- Development of a basic library for extraction of raw data from the IMU
- Preliminary testing

The ideal candidate(s) will have strong programming and embedded systems abilities and a familiarity with git and GitHub.
