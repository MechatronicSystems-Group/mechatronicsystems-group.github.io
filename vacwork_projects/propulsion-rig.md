title: "Software and user interface design for a propulsion rig"
---

One of the present research focuses within the MechatronicSystems.Group is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To this end, a rotor thrust rig is required, in order to develop a better understanding of the static and dynamic capabilities of various UAV propulsion systems. For example, a quadcopter makes use of a motor-propeller subsystem in order to develop the necessary thrust and torques.

The thrust rig must be able to measure thrust (using a load cell sensor), motor speed, and current. The measured data must then be displayable in quasi-real-time on a PC via a GUI, and also logged for offline data analysis purposes.

This project will require the student(s) to research, design, construct, and test a thrust rig. This will include:
<ul>
  <li>Researching current solutions</li>
  <li>Detailed CAD design of the physical structure</li>
  <li>Instrumentation selection and integration</li>
  <li>Design of communications, GUI, and logging capabilities on PC</li>
  <li>Preliminary testing of the system</li>
</ul>

The ideal candidate(s) will have strong CAD and instrumentation ability, whilst also requiring good knowledge of embedded systems and programming.
