One of the present research focuses within the MechatronicSystems.Group is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To this end, a rotor thrust rig is required, in order to develop a better understanding of the static and dynamic capabilities of various UAV propulsion systems. For example, a quadcopter makes use of a motor-propeller subsystem in order to develop the necessary thrust and torques.

The thrust rig must be able to measure thrust (using a load cell sensor), motor speed, and current. The measured data must then be displayable in quasi-real-time on a PC via a GUI, and also logged for offline data analysis purposes.

This project will require the student(s) to research, design, construct, and test a thrust rig. This will include:

-Researching current solutions
-Detailed CAD design of the physical structure
-Instrumentation selection and integration 
-Design of communications, GUI, and logging capabilities on PC.
-Preliminary testing of the system

The ideal candidate(s) will have strong CAD and instrumentation ability, whilst also requiring good knowledge of embedded systems and programming.
